## What is machine learning?

The term 'machine learning' is one of the most popular and frequently used terms of today. 
There is a nontrivial possibility that you have heard this term at least once if you have some sort of familiarity with technology, no matter what domain you
work in. The mechanics of machine learning, however, are a mystery to most people. For a machine learning beginner, the subject can sometimes feel overwhelming.
Therefore, it is important to understand what machine learning actually is,and to learn about it step by step, through practical examples.

## Why study machine learning?

Machine learning, from a systems perspective, is defined as the creation of automated systems that can learn hidden patterns from data to aid in making intelligent decisions.

This motivation is loosely inspired by how the human brain learns certain things based on the data it perceives from the outside world.

âœ… Think for a minute why a business would want to try to use machine learning strategies vs. creating a hard-coded rules-based engine.

## Conclusion

Machine learning automates the process of pattern-discovery by finding meaningful insights from real-world or generated data. It has proven itself to be highly valuable in business, health, and financial applications, among others.

In the near future, understanding the basics of machine learning is going to be a must for people from any domain due to its widespread adoption.
